# Replay prevention techniques are becoming more common for web applications, and can be difficult to overcome with a
# standard interception proxy alone
# This is a two-stage authentication challenge
# Start the twostageauth.py target (defaults to port 9942)
# Given lists of probable usernames and passwords (in this directory), code your way past the login using Python.
#
# Hints:
# - First examine the request and response traffic using a browser and Burp
# - See if you can figure out how the replay prevention mechanism works.  Can you defeat it to log in?
# - Consider using the requests module to do this in Python
#
# IMPORTANT: Stop the service (Ctrl-C) when you are done with the lab
