# Exercise: Write a script to open a socket on various ports on localhost.
# HINTS:
# - Consider using the higher-level socket.create_connection method, and set a timeout
# - Some common ports are: 20,21,22,23,80,25,26,37,57,70,110,119,194,389,443,3306,5432,8080
# - Or use a range to test all ports.
# - don't forget you can wrap code in a try - except block.  Use the keyword 'pass' in except blocks to do nothing.
# - print any banners returned by the services
