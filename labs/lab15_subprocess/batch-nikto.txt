# Exercise: Write a program that runs nikto across a batch of hosts.
#
# WARNING: NIKTO IS AN ACTIVE SCANNING TOOL! Make sure you HAVE PERMISSION to scan your targets.
# For the purpose of this lab, local applications http://mutillidae and http://localhost and http://bwapp are available.
#
# STEP A:
# Use the subprocess module to run nikto from within Python.
# - Pass in parameters for the host, and place results for each application into a separate output file.

# STEP B:
# Use the threading module to run multiple scans simultaneously.
