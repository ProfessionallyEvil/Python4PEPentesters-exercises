# Write a utility application that parses website URLs out of a standard Nessus (XML) output file.  The output should
# be either a textual list of URLs or (even better) HTML with a set of links that can be opened in the browser.
# Process the XML using a xml.sax.ContentHandler object.
#
# Hints:
# - Nessus plugin id 22964 is the service identity plugin
# - Specific service names that are typically websites are ['www', 'http?', 'https?']
# - Take note of the XML structure.  In particular nodes ReportHost and ReportItem are of interest.
# - You can guess whether the protocol is http or https by searching the plugin output, e.g. re.search('TLS|SSL', output)
