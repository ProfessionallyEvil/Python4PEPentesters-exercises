# Make a utility to do a reverse DNS lookup for an individual address or an entire list of ipv4 address
# A regular expression for an ipv4 pattern is as follows: ^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}$
#
# Hints:
# - Start with defining a lookup procedure that takes an ip address and returns either the hostname.
# - If a hostname cannot be determined, the procedure should return the ip address.
# - You can test with ip 8.8.8.8 (Google's DNS server)
# - Then use argparse to turn this into a utility that will accept an ip address or a file path.
# - Output, if specified, should go to a file.  Otherwise output just goes to stdout.
