# Exercise: Create a utility that will do whois lookups in batch given a list of hosts.  The utility should
# output the list of hosts from the input, but categorize them by name.  Consider other pieces of information that
# would be valuable during reconnaissance, such as network ranges specified in the whois results.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the ipwhois module to perform whois lookups.
# - Use nested dictionaries and/or lists to keep track of the information while running whois
