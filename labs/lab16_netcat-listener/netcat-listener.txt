# Exercise: We are going to create a muti-threaded netcat shell listener.


# STEP A:
# Let's start with a single-threaded echo listener.
# - This listener should echo whatever a client sends to it.
# - The client should loop, echoing each message, until the client sends an empty line.
# - Don't forget to close the connection when done.

# STEP B:
# Improve on our netcat listener by making it multi-threaded.
# - Specify the maximum number of concurrent sessions in the socket.listen() function
# - Test by connecting with two concurrent netcat sessions.

STEP C
# Change the behavior of the service.
# - Instead of repeating a what the client sends, run it using the os.popen function.
# - Return the output from popen line by line
