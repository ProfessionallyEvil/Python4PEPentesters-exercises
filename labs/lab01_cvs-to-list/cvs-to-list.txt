# Write a simple application to convert a comma-delimited list into a line-separated list.
# Test this with the input file 'targets.txt'

# STEP A:
# Read the csv line out of targets.txt.  Figure out how parse the string using a comma as a delimiter, so that the
# strings are in a list.  Print each line to stdout.  Clean up your output.
#
# HINTS:
# - Don't forget to close your file when you are done.
# - A string can be 'split' by a delimiter.  E.g.: word_list = sentence.split(' ')
# - The string's 'strip' function can remove whitespace from both sides of a string.

# STEP A:
# Import the argparse module and use it to specify an input file as a parameter.
