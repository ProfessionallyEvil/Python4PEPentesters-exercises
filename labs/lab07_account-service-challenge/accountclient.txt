# Run the Account Server service, which should run on port 9999.  You can interact with it on the command line
# using 'nc localhost 9999'.  There is a known test account called 'test' with pin '1234'.
# This service is known to be used by famous superheros.  They will usually use their secret identity's last
# name (in lowercase) as a login.  So start by making a list of 4-5 superhero last names.

# Hints:
#  - Remember that for loops can cover a range, eg:   for x in range(0,10): will loop from 0 to 9
#  - You may have to play with doing an extra recv() to get a prompt
#  - Test your logic with a couple of loops using the test account to make sure it works.
#  - Don't forget to close your socket when done
