# Exercise: Given a standard nmap file, generate a dictionary mapping open tcp port numbers to the frequency
# of that port.  A sample nmap output file has been provided but this should work on any nmap file.
#
# Hint:  Search each line for a common piece of information to identify which lines contain a port number

# STEP A
# - Start with an empty dictionary
# - open the 'mynetwork.nmap' file in read ('r') mode.
# - Read in the nmap file line-by-line
# - use a 'for' loop to iterate over each line of the nmap.  Parse out the port number and adjust the dictionary accordingly
# - don't forget to close the file!
# - print the results

# STEP B
# - Adjust your logic to maintain a port->ip addresses mapping instead of just a count.
# - The IP addresses should be a list

# STEP C (Bonus round)
# - use the argparse module to take in the file from the command line
