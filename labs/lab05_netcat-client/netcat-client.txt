# Create a simple pseudo-netclat client
#
# STEP A:
# - Start a netcat listener in a separate terminal window:  nc -lv 9999
# - Write a python script that will connect to the listener, send a test string, and receive and print a test response.
# - Don't forgot to close the socket when you are done.
# - use argparse to pass in host and port parameters
# - *** Hint: when calling recv(), remember you have to send it something.  Do so from your netcat listener.


# STEP B:
# Modify your program from STEP A by:
# - accepting user input from the command line instead of the test string.
# - placing your send/receive sequence in a loop that ends when you enter a "exit" or "quit" command


# BONUS FUN
# Replace your plain netcat listener with a shell netcat listener: nc -lv 9999 -e /bin/bash
# Use the script as in step B
