Exercises for the Python for Professionally Evil Pentesters Class

_Notes:_
* The master branch of this repo intentionally does not contain solutions.  The solutions can be found in the solutions branch.
* Some solutions may include a "-old" on the file name. This is intentional since some exercise solutions may have been developed during a different class, and in some cases the "-old" version is actually the better one, but may differ from what recent students have seen during class.
